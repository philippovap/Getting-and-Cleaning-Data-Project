# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Course Project

R script run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## How to use the code
The directory UCI HAR Dataset with initial data should be set as a working one.
Then run the script run_analysis.R. It will create the file called newdata.txt in the working directory.
